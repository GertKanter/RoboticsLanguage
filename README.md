# The Robotics Language

The Robotics Language (RoL) is a high level robotics programming language that generates ROS c++ nodes.


## Install

If you are a user run:
```shell
pip install .
```

If you are a developer run:
```shell
pip install -e .
```

## Examples
You can try the RoL compiler by testing the examples in the folder `RoboticsLanguage/Examples`:

```shell
rol RoboticsLanguage/Examples/helloworld.rol
```

This will create a ROS node in the folder `~/deploy`. If you have installed the catkin workspace at `~/catkin_ws` then you can supply the path to the compiler and compile and launch the node directly:

```shell
rol -p ~/catkin_ws/src/deploy/ RoboticsLanguage/Examples/helloworld.rol -c -l
```

## Docker image

You can test the robotics language using a docker environment. First build the docker file

```shell
docker build --tag roboticslanguage .
```

Next start the container

```shell
docker run -it --rm --workdir=/root/RoboticsLanguage roboticslanguage
```

Once inside the docker container you can compile the example by sourcing the file `source_in_docker.sh`:

```shell
source source_in_docker.sh
```


you can launch the `hello_world` node by using the RoL:

```shell
rol RoboticsLanguage/Examples/helloworld.rol -l
```
or by using `roslaunch`

```shell
roslaunch hello_world hello_world.launch
```
