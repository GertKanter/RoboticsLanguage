# The Robotics Language

The Robotics Language (RoL) is a high level robotics programming language that generates ROS c++ nodes.


## **note for RosIN reviewers**

This software represents milestone 1 of the Robotics Language proposal. As such, the structure of the compiler is complete and working, but the capabilities of the language are very limited. These will be implemented in milestone 2. Documentation is also planned for milestone 2, so at this moment only the source code is commented. The guide below can be used to test the current state of the software.

## Install

If you are a user use:
```shell
pip install .
```

If you are a developer use:
```shell
pip install -e .
```

## Examples
You can try the RoL compiler by testing the examples in the folder `RoboticsLanguage/Examples`:

```shell
rol RoboticsLanguage/Examples/helloworld.rol
```

This will create a ROS node in the folder `~/deploy`. If you have installed the catkin workspace at `~/catkin_ws` then you can supply the path to the compiler and compile and launch the node directly:

```shell
rol -p ~/catkin_ws/src/deploy/ RoboticsLanguage/Examples/helloworld.rol -c -l
```

## Docker image

You can test the robotics language using a docker environment. First download a standard ROS distribution

```shell
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/RoL --workdir=/RoL osrf/ros:kinetic-desktop
```

Once inside the docker container you can source the file `run_in_docker.sh`:


```shell
source source_in_docker.sh
```

This will perform a number of steps and eventually will compile the example node `hello_world`.
To launch this node run:

```shell
roslaunch hello_world hello_world.launch
```
